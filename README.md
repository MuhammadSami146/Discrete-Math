# Discrete-math
This repository is for my project of discrete structure.
<br>
The project is based on graph theory to explore the student network and find the patterns in the graph. The 
project code should be in C++. Modularity is at the center of the project. All modules should be defined 
with clear parameter, outcome, and member assignment details.
Read the data from the file and load in array(s).
Following are the tasks to be performed
1. Find the most popular student(s) of the class. Popular is the one that is friend of maximum students.
2. Find the asymmetric friendship ordered pairs. A friendship ordered pair (A,B) is asymmetric if 
there doesn’t exists (B,A) in the dataset.
3. Given a student A, find the students that are 1-hop, 2-hop, and 3-hop away from a given student.
4. Use GUI library to show (3) on screen.
5. Create a multiciplity graph to represented weighted strength between two students. A weighted 
edge between two students represent the number of common friends.
6. Find the potential friendships based on the multiplicity graph. A potential friendship is the one that 
is not part of the student network but is part of multiplicity graph satisfying a minimum threshold 
α.
7. Use GUI library to show (6) on screen.
8. Find the broadcast points of the class.
